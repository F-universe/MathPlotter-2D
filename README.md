2D Function Plotter
2D Function Plotter is a simple web app that allows you to graph mathematical functions on a 2D Cartesian plane. You can input functions in the form y = f(x) or x = f(y) and see interactive graphs powered by Plotly.js.

Features
Plot functions in 2D (both y = f(x) and x = f(y)).
Interactive graphs with zoom and pan.
Supports complex math expressions using math.js.
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copia codice
git clone https://github.com/your_username/2d-function-plotter.git
Open index.html in your browser.
Enter a function and click "Plot Function" to see the graph.
Example Functions
y = x^2 + 2x
x = y^2
y = sin(x)
